Think of it as:

> “The frontend of a real product — not a landing page.”

## What You Should “Look Like” After PROJECT 1

### Identity After Project 1

By the end of Project 1, you should be able to honestly say:

> “I can design and build a secure, clean web interface from scratch  
> without guessing, without panic, and without AI doing the thinking for me.”

### Skills You’ll Visibly Have

**Frontend**

- You can:
    
    - Lay out pages confidently (Flexbox, Grid)
        
    - Use Tailwind **intentionally**, not randomly
        
    - Create consistent spacing, colors, and hierarchy
        
- Your UI looks:
    
    - Calm
        
    - Structured
        
    - Not flashy, but professional
        

**Security Awareness**

- You understand:
    
    - Why forms are dangerous
        
    - What validation actually protects
        
    - Why authentication is fragile
        
- You can explain (in simple words):
    
    - What happens when a user logs in
        
    - Where attacks usually happen

## What You Should “Look Like” After PROJECT 2

Project 2 is where your **identity sharpens**.

### Identity After Project 2

You are now:

> “Someone who understands both the _user experience_  
> and the _attack surface_ of a web application.”

This is the turning point.

### Skills You’ll Have After Project 2

**Frontend (Stronger)**

- You can:
    
    - Build multi-page flows
        
    - Handle loading states, errors, empty states
        
    - Design with _intent_, not decoration
        
- You understand:
    
    - Accessibility basics
        
    - Responsive design deeply
        

**Security (Real, Not Theoretical)**

- You can:
    
    - Identify insecure frontend patterns
        
    - Explain why certain UI decisions are risky
        
- You understand:
    
    - Token storage risks
        
    - Session handling at a high level
        
    - Why “just hiding things in the frontend” is fake security
        

**Thinking Like an Engineer**

- You start asking:
    
    - “What happens if this fails?”
        
    - “What happens if someone abuses this?”
        
- This mindset is what security _actually_ is.

## Warning Signs I am Learning Wrong

- You’re watching more videos than coding
- You can’t start a project from scratch
- You feel busy but can’t explain concepts
- You rely on AI for every decision

*Solution* - Stop watching tutorials immediately

## My AI Use

Use AI to:

- Explain concepts
- Debug
- Suggest improvements
- Ask “why is this insecure?”

Do NOT:

- Copy without understanding
- Skip design decisions
- Avoid reading your own code

==If you can’t explain your code **without AI**, you don’t own it.==
